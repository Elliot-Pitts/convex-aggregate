# Convex Component: Aggregate

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Faggregate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Faggregate)

This Convex component calculates count and sums of values for efficient
aggregation.

Suppose you have a leaderboard of game scores. These are some operations
that the Aggregate component makes easy and efficient, with `O(log(n))`-time
lookups:

1. Count the total number of scores: `aggregate.count(ctx)`
2. Count the number of scores greater than 65: `aggregate.count(ctx, { lower: { key: 65, inclusive: true } })`
3. Find the p95 score: `aggregate.at(ctx, Math.floor(aggregate.count(ctx) * 0.95))`
4. Find the average score: `aggregate.sum(ctx) / aggregate.count(ctx)`
5. Find the ranking for a score of 65 in the leaderboard: `aggregate.rankOf(ctx, 65)`
6. Find the average score for a user:

```ts
const bounds = { lower: { key: username, inclusive: true }, upper: { key: username, inclusive: true } };
const avgScoreForUser = aggregateByUser.sum(ctx, bounds) / aggregateByUser.count(ctx, bounds);
```

# What are Aggregates for?

With plain Convex indexes, you can insert new documents and you can paginate
through all documents. But you don't want to lose sight of the forest for the
trees. Sometimes you want big-picture data that encompases many of your
individual data points, and that's where aggregates come in.

The Aggregates component keeps a data structure with denormalized counts and
sums. It's effectively a key-value store which is sorted by the key, and where
you can count values that lie between two keys.

The keys may be arbitrary Convex values, so you can choose to sort your data by:

1. a number, like a leaderboard score
2. a string, like user ids -- so you can count the data owned by each user
3. an [index key](https://stack.convex.dev/pagination#whats-an-index-key), for
   full pagination support
4. nothing, use `key=null` for everything if you just want a counter

## More examples

- In a messaging app, how many messages have been sent within the past month?
- Offset-based pagination: view the 100th page of photos, where each page has
  50 photos.
- Look up a random song in a table, as the next song to play.

# How to install

See `example/` for a working demo.

1. Install the Aggregate component:

```bash
npm install @convex-dev/aggregate
```

2. Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import aggregate from "@convex-dev/aggregate/convex.config.js";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(aggregate);
export default app;
```

3. Initialize the data structure so you can start writing to it.

```bash
npx convex run --component aggregate btree:init
# If there will be frequent writes, reduce contention by calculating top-level
# aggregates lazily.
npx convex run --component aggregate btree:makeRootLazy
```

# How to Use

## Write to the aggregate data structure

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { AggregateWriter } from "@convex-dev/aggregate";
const aggregateWriter = new AggregateWriter<number, Id<"mytable">>(components.aggregate);

// within a mutation, add values to be aggregated
await aggregateWriter.insert(ctx, key, id);
// or delete values that were previously added
await aggregateWriter.delete(ctx, key, id);
// or update values
await aggregateWriter.replace(ctx, oldKey, newKey, id);
```

> If you want to automatically update the aggregates based on changes to a table,
> [you can use](https://stack.convex.dev/custom-functions)
> `customFunction`s to wrap `ctx.db` in mutations. We intend to make this flow
> simpler; reach out in [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) to let us know if
> you're interested.

## Calculate aggregates

```ts
// convex/myfunctions.ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { Aggregate } from "@convex-dev/aggregate";
const aggregate = new Aggregate<number, Id<"mytable">>(components.aggregate);

// then in your queries and mutations you can do
const tableCount = await aggregate.count(ctx);
// or any of the other examples listed above.
```

# üßë‚Äçüè´ What is Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is a hosted backend platform with a
built-in database that lets you write your
[database schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) and
[server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/typescript). Server-side database
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) automatically
[cache](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching--reactivity) and
[subscribe](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#reactivity) to data, powering a
[realtime `useQuery` hook](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#fetching-data) in our
[React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). There are also clients for
[Python](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python),
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust),
[ReactNative](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react-native), and
[Node](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript), as well as a straightforward
[HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api/).

The database supports
[NoSQL-style documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-storage) with
[opt-in schema validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas),
[relationships](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) and
[custom indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/)
(including on fields in nested objects).

The
[`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) server functions have transactional,
low latency access to the database and leverage our
[`v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) with
[determinism guardrails](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations)
to provide the strongest ACID guarantees on the market:
immediate consistency,
serializable isolation, and
automatic conflict resolution via
[optimistic multi-version concurrency control](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ) (OCC / MVCC).

The [`action` server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) have
access to external APIs and enable other side-effects and non-determinism in
either our
[optimized `v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) or a more
[flexible `node` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

Functions can run in the background via
[scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).

Development is cloud-first, with
[hot reloads for server function](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server) editing via the
[CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli),
[preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments),
[logging and exception reporting integrations](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/),
There is a
[dashboard UI](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard) to
[browse and edit data](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data),
[edit environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables),
[view logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs),
[run server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions), and more.

There are built-in features for
[reactive pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination),
[file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage),
[reactive text search](https://docs.convex.dev/text-search),
[vector search](https://docs.convex.dev/vector-search),
[https endpoints](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) (for webhooks),
[snapshot import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/),
[streaming import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export), and
[runtime validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#validators) for
[function arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[database data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schema-validation).

Everything scales automatically, and it‚Äôs [free to start](https://www.convex.dev/plans).
